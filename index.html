    <h2>Self to Structured</h2>
    <p>
                I am a married father of three kids, two girls, and one boy. I was born in Atlanta, Georgia, but raised
                in
                Birmingham, Alabama. I currently reside in Conyers, Ga. Gowing up I’ve always had a strong desire to
                learn
                more about the IT field. With this interest I found myself being the family’s tech support. Eventually
                working for T-Mobile call center for six years as a Tech Representative then Tech Coach (supervisor).
                Recently as my interest building now to a burning desire to learn to code, I have spent the last several
                months teaching myself coding from the ground up.
